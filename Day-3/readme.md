## Day 3: Building Reusable Infrastructure with Modules

#### Creating Modular Infrastructure with Terraform Modules

Unlock the potential of reusability with Terraform modules. Understand how modules enable you to create shareable and organized infrastructure components.

#### Local Values and Data Sources

Simplify complex expressions using local values. Dive into data sources and learn how to fetch data from existing resources or external systems, enhancing your configurations' flexibility.

#### Using Variables and Inputs with Modules

Explore the versatility of using variables within modules to customize their behavior. Learn how inputs work within modules and the benefits they offer.

#### Leveraging Outputs from Modules

Utilize module outputs to access critical information or propagate data to your root configuration. Learn how to make your modules more informative and useful.

#### Exploring Terraform Registry for Modules

Embark on a journey through the Terraform Registry. Discover pre-built, community-contributed modules and learn how to incorporate them into your own configurations.
